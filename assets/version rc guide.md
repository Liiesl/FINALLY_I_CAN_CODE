# Explanation of `version.rc` Parameters

The `version.rc` file is a **resource script** used to embed version information and metadata into Windows executables. Below is a detailed explanation of each parameter in the `version.rc` file.

---

## 1. **`VS_VERSION_INFO VERSIONINFO`**
   - This is the root block that defines the version information structure.
   - `VS_VERSION_INFO` is a predefined resource type for version information.
   - `VERSIONINFO` indicates that this block contains version-related metadata.

---

## 2. **`FILEVERSION 1,0,0,0`**
   - Specifies the **file version** of the executable.
   - The version is represented as four numbers: `major, minor, build, revision`.
   - Example: `1,0,0,0` means version `1.0.0.0`.
   - This is displayed in the "File Version" field in the executable's properties.

---

## 3. **`PRODUCTVERSION 1,0,0,0`**
   - Specifies the **product version** of the executable.
   - Like `FILEVERSION`, it is represented as four numbers: `major, minor, build, revision`.
   - Example: `1,0,0,0` means product version `1.0.0.0`.
   - This is displayed in the "Product Version" field in the executable's properties.

---

## 4. **`FILEFLAGSMASK 0x3fL`**
   - Defines a bitmask that specifies which bits in `FILEFLAGS` are valid.
   - `0x3fL` is a common value that includes all standard flags.

---

## 5. **`FILEFLAGS 0x0L`**
   - Specifies the **file flags** (attributes) for the executable.
   - `0x0L` means no special flags are set.
   - Common flags include:
     - `VS_FF_DEBUG` (0x1L): The file is a debug build.
     - `VS_FF_PRERELEASE` (0x2L): The file is a pre-release version.
     - `VS_FF_PATCHED` (0x4L): The file has been patched.
     - `VS_FF_PRIVATEBUILD` (0x8L): The file is a private build.
     - `VS_FF_SPECIALBUILD` (0x20L): The file is a special build.

---

## 6. **`FILEOS 0x40004L`**
   - Specifies the **operating system** for which the executable is intended.
   - `0x40004L` corresponds to `VOS_NT_WINDOWS32`, meaning the executable is designed for 32-bit Windows NT-based systems (e.g., Windows 10, 11).

---

## 7. **`FILETYPE 0x1L`**
   - Specifies the **type of file**.
   - `0x1L` corresponds to `VFT_APP`, meaning the file is an application (executable).

---

## 8. **`FILESUBTYPE 0x0L`**
   - Specifies the **subtype of the file**.
   - `0x0L` means no subtype is defined (common for applications).

---

## 9. **`BEGIN ... END` Blocks**
   - These blocks define the actual metadata strings and translations.

---

## 10. **`BLOCK "StringFileInfo"`**
   - This block contains **string information** (metadata) for the executable.
   - It is divided into sub-blocks for different languages and character sets.

---

## 11. **`BLOCK "040904b0"`**
   - This is a **language and character set block**.
   - `0409` is the language ID for **English (United States)**.
   - `04b0` is the character set ID for **Unicode (UTF-16)**.

---

## 12. **String Metadata Values**
   - These are key-value pairs that define specific metadata for the executable:
     - **`CompanyName`**: The name of the company or organization.
     - **`FileDescription`**: A short description of the file.
     - **`FileVersion`**: The version of the file (as a string).
     - **`InternalName`**: The internal name of the file.
     - **`LegalCopyright`**: Copyright information.
     - **`OriginalFilename`**: The original name of the file.
     - **`ProductName`**: The name of the product.
     - **`ProductVersion`**: The version of the product (as a string).

---

## 13. **`BLOCK "VarFileInfo"`**
   - This block contains **variable information**, such as translations.

---

## 14. **`VALUE "Translation", 0x409, 1200`**
   - Specifies the **language and character set** for the metadata.
   - `0x409` is the language ID for **English (United States)**.
   - `1200` is the character set ID for **Unicode (UTF-16)**.

# Common `FILEOS` Values

Here are some common `FILEOS` values for different platforms:

| Value       | Platform Description                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `0x40004L`  | 32-bit Windows NT (`VOS_NT_WINDOWS32`)   |
| `0x40005L`  | 64-bit Windows NT (`VOS_NT_WINDOWS64`)   |
| `0x10001L`  | 16-bit Windows (`VOS_DOS_WINDOWS16`)     |
| `0x10004L`  | 32-bit Windows (`VOS_DOS_WINDOWS32`)     |

---

# `FILEFLAGS` Values

The `FILEFLAGS` field allows you to specify additional attributes or states of your executable. Here’s a detailed list of **`FILEFLAGS` values** and their meanings:

| Flag Name               | Value (Hex) | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VS_FF_DEBUG`           | `0x1L`      | The file is a **debug build**.                                              |
| `VS_FF_PRERELEASE`      | `0x2L`      | The file is a **pre-release version** (e.g., alpha or beta).                |
| `VS_FF_PATCHED`         | `0x4L`      | The file has been **patched** (modified after release).                     |
| `VS_FF_PRIVATEBUILD`    | `0x8L`      | The file is a **private build** (not released publicly).                    |
| `VS_FF_INFOINFERRED`    | `0x10L`     | The file's version information is inferred (not explicitly set).            |
| `VS_FF_SPECIALBUILD`    | `0x20L`     | The file is a **special build** (e.g., customized for a specific purpose).  |

---

## Example Usage of `FILEFLAGS`

If your executable is a **beta build**, you can set the `FILEFLAGS` to `0x2L` (pre-release). If it is also a **debug build**, you can combine the flags using the bitwise OR operator (`|`):

```rc
FILEFLAGS 0x2L | 0x1L  # Pre-release (beta) and debug build
```

This would result in `FILEFLAGS 0x3L`.

---

# Full Example for a Beta Build

Here’s an example `version.rc` file for a **beta build** of a 64-bit application:

```rc
VS_VERSION_INFO VERSIONINFO
FILEVERSION     1,0,0,0          # File version: 1.0.0.0
PRODUCTVERSION  1,0,0,0          # Product version: 1.0.0.0
FILEFLAGSMASK   0x3fL            # Bitmask for valid file flags
FILEFLAGS       0x2L             # Pre-release (beta)
FILEOS          0x40005L         # Designed for 64-bit Windows NT
FILETYPE        0x1L             # File type: Application
FILESUBTYPE     0x0L             # No subtype
BEGIN
    BLOCK "StringFileInfo"       # Start of string metadata
    BEGIN
        BLOCK "040904b0"         # English (United States), Unicode
        BEGIN
            VALUE "CompanyName", "My Company"          # Company name
            VALUE "FileDescription", "My Application"  # File description
            VALUE "FileVersion", "1.0.0 Beta"          # File version (string)
            VALUE "InternalName", "my_app"             # Internal name
            VALUE "LegalCopyright", "Copyright (C) 2023" # Copyright info
            VALUE "OriginalFilename", "my_app.exe"     # Original filename
            VALUE "ProductName", "My Application"      # Product name
            VALUE "ProductVersion", "1.0.0 Beta"       # Product version (string)
        END
    END
    BLOCK "VarFileInfo"          # Start of variable metadata
    BEGIN
        VALUE "Translation", 0x409, 1200  # English (United States), Unicode
    END
END
```
